## My process

- 🔎 Analyzed the screenshots to identify the different pages, components and features.
- ✍️ Wrote down everything I thought I would need to learn to complete this challenge. *(This includes almost everything about React since it's my first project with it, but I knew I would need state, context, router, creating components & something to fetch my data)*
- 📄 Read a lot of documentation about different methods and videos/guides to have multiple explanations.
- 🏠 Built the Homepage, then extracted the components such as header, search bar, region selector, country cards. I started by using a small sample of fake content, then installed **axios** to fetch the data from my json file.
- 📄 Built the Country page, then installed **react-router-dom** to create a router and define my paths.
- 💻 Styled the desktop-version
- 🌗 Implemented the dark-mode/light-mode feature with a theme context provider & **useContext** hook.
- ⚙️ Installed **gh-pages** and set up the config files so that the app can be built and deployed to Github Pages.
- 🪳 Debugged and tested on multiple devices to make sure the features are available.

### What I learned

- React Basics : Component creation, state management with `useState` and `useEffect`.
- Context API : Creating and using context providers to manage global state.
- Routing: Setting up and managing routes with `react-router-dom`.
- Data Fetching: Using `axios` to fetch data from an API or local JSON file.
- Styling: Applying styles for different screen sizes and implementing themes with **TailwindCSS**.
- Dark Mode: Managing themes with context and conditional styling.
- Deployment: Building and deploying a React application to GitHub Pages.
- Testing and Debugging: Ensuring cross-device compatibility and fixing bugs.

I also read about `useMemo` and `useCallback` (that I think I should use here), Tanstack (react query), data pagination, local storage. 

I plan on diving deeper into useMemo and useCallback, React Query, component structure, error handling, custom hooks, Redux, Suspense mode and accessibility.

**Any feedback welcome**
